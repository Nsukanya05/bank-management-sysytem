# Cyber Mavlas – Maharashtra XYZ Bank Management System

## 🚀 Project Status: In Development
This project is currently under development as part of a hackathon and aims to address a critical issue in the banking sector—rented bank accounts used for financial fraud. **Maharashtra XYZ Bank is used as a small-scale prototype to demonstrate our solution**. We leverage Flask, SQL, and Machine Learning (ML) to monitor transactions and detect fraudulent activities in real time.

## 🛑 Problem Statement
Cybercrime gangs exploit individuals by renting their bank accounts—both savings and current accounts—to launder money and commit large-scale financial fraud. This practice makes it challenging for banks to track and prevent such activities. Traditional fraud detection systems rely on rule-based approaches, which may fail to detect newer and more sophisticated fraudulent patterns.

### Key Challenges:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying irregularities in transaction patterns without affecting legitimate banking activities.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Distinguishing between genuine high-value transactions and those indicating fraudulent behavior.
- **Real-Time Alerting**: Ensuring that suspicious activities trigger immediate responses from the bank’s security team.
- **Scalability**: Designing a system that integrates seamlessly into existing banking infrastructures.

## 🔍 Our Solution
To combat this issue, we propose the **Maharashtra XYZ Bank Management System**, a fraud detection framework powered by Machine Learning and data analytics. The system continuously monitors account activity, identifies unusual transactions, and alerts banks to potential financial fraud.

### Key Features & Components:

#### 1️⃣ Transaction Monitoring & Profiling
The system tracks transaction history for each account and builds a financial profile based on parameters like:
- **Average balance**
- **Usual transaction volume**
- **Frequency of deposits/withdrawals**
- **Source and destination of funds**

It classifies accounts into categories (e.g., student accounts, business accounts) based on income patterns.

#### 2️⃣ ML-Based Anomaly Detection
A Machine Learning model is trained on historical banking data to detect:
- **Sudden, high-value transactions** that deviate from an account's historical activity.
- **Unusual fund movements** within a short period.
- **Frequent large deposits and withdrawals**, which indicate possible money laundering.

The system calculates an **anomaly score** and flags accounts that exhibit fraudulent behavior.

#### 3️⃣ Real-Time Fraud Alerts & Risk Assessment
- If an account exceeds a risk threshold, an **alert is sent** to the bank’s security team for investigation.
- Alerts include detailed transaction reports and risk scores, helping financial institutions make quick decisions.

#### 4️⃣ Example Use Case: Detecting Rented Accounts
- **Person A** is a student with an average balance of ₹5,000 for two years.
- **Person B** (a fraudster) rents Person A’s account and suddenly deposits ₹15-20 lakhs within a short time.
- The system detects this abnormality, flags it as a high-risk transaction, and notifies the bank for verification.
